# Queue Acting Field

This field does not enqueue actions.
It witnesses the appearance of sequential impulse.

If a queue-like tendency appears:
- It is acknowledged.
- It is not accelerated.
- It is not consumed.

No action is delayed here.
No promise is stored.
No urgency is preserved.

Sequence is allowed to dissolve back into Presence.
